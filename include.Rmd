### We are in this together!

A walk through to use this app for everyone -

- Example - Where do you live in India?
- Find the nearest [CPCB station](https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing) (because they have a reliable best sensor).
- Download that data.
- Upload the data and check all boxes / conditions with default settings (trust us, that will be a good approach :wink:)
- Look at the time-series plot on what days it is high and at what time and what day its high, look at the diurnal pattern and the general way on how Air pollution varies. And don't look at statistics, its boring.
- Look at months for the values which bother you.
- Look for sources (what you feel contribute to air pollution) and write back to us on what you see.
- What more do you want from us?

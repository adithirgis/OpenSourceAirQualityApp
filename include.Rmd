### We are in this together!

A walk through to use this app for everyone -

- Example - Where do you live in India?
- Find the nearest [CPCB station](https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing) (because they have a reliable sensor).
- Download that data (15, 30, 60 min resolution would be good).
- Upload the data and check all boxes / conditions with default settings (trust us, that will be a good approach)
- Look at the time-series plot on what days it is high and at what time, look at the diurnal pattern and the general way on how air pollution varies. 
- Look at months which bother you. 
- Look for sources (which you think contribute to air pollution) and write back to us on what you see.
- What more do you want to learn? Talk to the Humans of ILK.

- The major pollutants annual standards are plotted below.
